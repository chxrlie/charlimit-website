## ‚ú® Features

This portfolio is not just a static page; it includes several key features to create an immersive and functional experience:

* **Retro Terminal Aesthetic:** The entire design is wrapped in a terminal emulator style, complete with:
    * CRT scanline and noise effects.
    * Glowing text and pulse animations to mimic an old monitor.
    * A colour scheme inspired by popular code editor themes.
* **Neovim-Inspired UI:** The user interface borrows elements from the Neovim text editor, including:
    * A large ASCII art logo.
    * Navigation links styled as `:Commands`.
    * A call-to-action button styled as `:wq!` (the save and quit command).
* **Dynamic Content via API:** The Neovim version number in the status bar is not hard-coded. It is fetched live from the **GitHub API**, ensuring it always displays the latest release version of Neovim.
* **Interactive Contact Section:** To make contacting simple and reduce errors, the contact section includes:
    * A "Copy Email" button that instantly copies the email address to the user's clipboard.
    * Clear visual feedback to confirm that the address has been copied.
* **Accessibility-Focused Design:** Readability was a primary concern. The portfolio uses the **Atkinson Hyperlegible** font, which is specifically designed to improve character recognition and readability for all users, especially those with low vision.
* **Responsive Layout:** The design adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, providing a consistent experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
